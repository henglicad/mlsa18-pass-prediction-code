\section{Introduction} \label{intro}
%This section discuss our motivation, briefly mention our approach, and introduce the research questions that we want to answer:
In a football game, players pass the ball to their teammates in order to create good shooting opportunities or prevent the opposing team from getting the control of the ball.
Accurately passing ball to the right player is essential for winning a football game~\cite{Ali2011Measuring,Hughes2005Analysis}.

Prior work~\cite{reep1968skill,Hughes2005Analysis} studies how passing sequences lead to goals. Their findings have shaped the tactics of many football coaches.
In this work, we study football players' passing patterns and construct machine learning models to anticipate passing targets.
We believe that football coaches and players can take our results into consideration when they make their tactics or make their passes/runs. For example, anticipating passing targets can help players be aware of the best positions to get a pass.

This work analyzes a dataset which contains 12,124 passes performed by a Belgian football club in 14 games. We want to answer the following research questions: 

\begin{description}
	\item \textbf{RQ1: what are players' passing patterns?}
	
	For example, most of the passes are passing forwards.
	
	\item \textbf{RQ2: how well can we model passing targets?}
	\item \textbf{RQ3: what are the influential factors that explain the passing targets?}
\end{description}
