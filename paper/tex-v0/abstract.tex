Football (or association football) is a highly-collaborative team sport. 
Passing the ball to the right person is essential for winning a football game.
Anticipating the receiver of a pass can help football players build better collaborations on the field and help coaches make better tactic decisions.
In this work, we use a machine learning model to learn how professional football players pass the ball, and leverage the model to predict the receivers of football passes.
%Our model can predict the receivers with a top-1 accuracy of 50\% and a top-5 accuracy of 94\%.
Our model's first guess, top-3 guesses and top-5 guesses find the correct receiver of a pass with an accuracy of 50\%, 84\% and 94\%, respectively.
This paper discusses the features that we use to build our model, our modeling approach, and the important factors that explain the the receiver of a pass.
