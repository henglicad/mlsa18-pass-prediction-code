Football is a highly-collaborative sports. 
Passing the ball to the right person is essential for winning a football game.
Anticipating the target of a pass can help football players build better collaborations on the field and help coaches make better tactic decisions.
In this work, we use machine learning models to learn how professional football players pass the ball, and leverage the models to predict the targets of football passes.
Our models can predict the passing target with a top-1 accuracy of 41\% and a top-5 accuracy of 82\% (\todo{numbers to be updated}).
This paper discusses the features that we use to build our models, our modeling approaches, and the important factors that explain the the target of a pass.
