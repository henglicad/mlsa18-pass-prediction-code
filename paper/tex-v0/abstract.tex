Football (or association football) is a highly-collaborative team sport. 
Passing the ball to the right person is essential for winning a football game.
Anticipating the receiver of a pass can help football players build better collaborations on the field and help coaches make better tactic decisions.
In this work, we use machine learning models to learn how professional football players pass the ball, and leverage the models to predict the receivers of football passes.
%Our models can predict the receivers with a top-1 accuracy of 49\% and a top-5 accuracy of 94\%.
Our model's first guess, top-3 guesses and top-5 guesses find the correct receiver of a pass with an accuracy of 49\%, 83\% and 94\%, respectively.
This paper discusses the features that we use to build our models, our modeling approaches, and the important factors that explain the the receiver of a pass.
