Football (or association football) is a highly-collaborative team sport. 
Passing the ball to the right player is essential for winning a football game.
Anticipating the receiver of a pass can help football players build better collaborations on the field and help coaches make better tactic decisions.
%In this work, we study how professional football players pass the ball, and build a machine learning model to predict the receiver of a pass.
In this work, we analyze a public dataset that contains 12,124 passes performed by professional football players.
First, we study the characteristics of the passes, e.g., the distance of the passes.
Then, we extract five dimensions of features from the dataset and build a gradient boosting model to predict the receiver of a pass. 
Our model's first guess, top-3 guesses and top-5 guesses find the correct receiver of a pass with an accuracy of 50\%, 84\% and 94\%, respectively.
%This paper discusses the features that we use to build our model, our modeling approach, and the important factors that explain the the receiver of a pass.
