\section{Conclusions} \label{conclusions}

This work proposes a novel approach to predict the receivers of football passes.
We analyze a dataset containing 12,124 passes from 14 real-world football games, and discusses players' passing patterns. We find that players present different passing patterns in different areas of the field.
We then extract 54 features along five dimensions and build a LightGBM model to predict the target of a pass. 
Our model achieves a top-1, top-3, and top-5 accuracy of 50\%, 84\%, and 94\%, respectively, when we exclude false passes.
We believe that our approaches and findings can help football practitioners understand the patterns of football passes and make informed tactics in football games.
