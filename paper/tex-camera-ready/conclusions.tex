\section{Conclusions} \label{conclusions}

This work proposes a novel approach to predict the receivers of football passes.
We analyze a dataset containing 12,124 passes from 14 real-world football games, and discuss players' passing characteristics. We find that players present different passing characteristics in different areas of the field.
We then extract 54 features along five dimensions and build a LightGBM model to predict the receiver of a pass. 
Our model achieves a top-1, top-3, and top-5 accuracy of 50\%, 84\%, and 94\%, respectively, when we exclude false passes.
Our model outperforms three baseline models that we use to rank the candidate receivers of a pass.
We find that the features that capture the positions of the candidate receivers play the most important roles in explaining the receiver of a pass.
%We believe that our approaches and findings can help football practitioners understand the characteristics of football passes and make informed tactical decisions.
