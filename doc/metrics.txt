This file describes the metrics that we use to predict the passing target.

Big question: how to reconstruct players' relative locations in the field?
Proposal: Divide the field into many squares (square size is a super parameter), and sort them by their dangerousness (e.g., distance to the goal line, angle to the goal line). For each square, use 0 to indicate neither teammates or opponents in the square, use 1 to indicate teammates in the square, and use -1 to indicate opponents in the square, and use 2 to indicate both teammates and opponents in the square. Build model or construct rules to predict the target square. 

Response variable:
  Receiver id

Sender metrics:
  Sender X/Y coordinates
  Sender X/Y rank
  Location of closest opponent
  Location of second-closest opponent
  
Candidate receiver metrics:
  Receiver X/Y coordidates
  Receiver X/Y rank
  Reciever angle (angle of the sender - receiver path and sender - opponent path)

Opposing team metrics:

Time metrics:
  Passing start time


Some thoughts:
Firstly use some heuristics to filter out unlikely passing targets (e.g., teammates behind a components, or passing back to goalkeeper from the front half)
